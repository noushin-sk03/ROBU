Rock Paper Scissors – Java Console Game

What the Project Does:

This is a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Java where a user plays against the computer. After each round, the game shows the result (win/lose/tie) and keeps track of the score. The user can continue playing as many rounds as they like until they choose to quit.

Tools / Languages Used:

- Java
- Scanner class for user input
- Basic control flow constructs (if-else, loops, arrays)

Steps to Build and Run:

1. Save the file as RPSwl.java.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:
   javac RPSwl.java
4. Run the program:
   java RPSwl

Follow the prompts to enter your move (r, p, or s) and see the computer’s move and result.

Challenges / Key Features:

Key Features:
- Accepts valid user input (r, p, s)
- Loops until the user chooses to stop
- Tracks and displays wins, losses, and ties after each round
- Simple logic to determine the game result

Known Challenge:
- Predictable Computer Moves: The computer plays in a fixed sequence: Rock → Paper → Scissors → Rock... This makes its behaviour predictable over time, which reduces the challenge of the game.

Future Plans:

- Introduce randomised computer moves using the Random class for more unpredictability.
- Improve user experience with better UI messages or a GUI version.
- Add support for input validation improvements and error handling.
